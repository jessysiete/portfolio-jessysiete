## Fix Bug
### 1. Github Profile section not displaying profile
  - previous working state displayed my personal profile
  - currently consistently displaying 'Loading...' text
  - 'Github Profile' tab in main nav is unresponsive
  - possibly due to profile username change and/or updated api token needed
