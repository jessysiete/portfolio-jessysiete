            <strong>The Pintern</strong> was born from my love for design,
            branding, and small-scale manufacturing. What started as wooden
            laser-cut pins evolved into a fully developed enamel pin brand.
            Through this venture, I managed product and packaging design,
            product lifecyle, sourcing, branding, marketing, and retail
            logisticsâ€”all skills I apply in tech & operations-focused roles.

          <h2 className="concept-title">Concept & Idea</h2>
          <p className="concept-text">
            My journey into enamel pins started in college, where I designed
            flyers and branding materials for student organizations. Over time,
            this evolved into creating wearable designs for organizations to
            showcase their identity. The Pintern started as an experimental
            ventureâ€”how could I turn **small-scale product ideas** into
            high-quality, manufacturable designs? Inspired by my love for
            branding and material experimentation, I began testing different
            production techniques, refining my skills in **vector illustration,
            color theory, and enamel application** to bring each concept to
            life. Inspired by my work in graphic design and experience working
            with manufacturers in the shoe industry, I saw an opportunity to
            merge both worldsâ€”resulting in The Pintern.

            Scaling, Prototyping & Iteration
          </h2>
          <p className="prototyping-text">
            I initially created wood-cut pins with my CNC laser but needed a
            scalable solution. Transitioning to enamel pins allowed me to
            manufacture at volume while focusing on design and branding. Before
            finalizing any pin design, I conducted multiple **rounds of
            prototyping**â€”testing colors, finishes, and materials to ensure the
            highest quality outcome. This process mirrored the iterative
            development cycles used in **product design and software
            engineering**, emphasizing feedback loops and continuous refinement.

          Step 1: Concept & IdeationEach pin started with a purposeâ€”either as a brand collaboration, sorority keepsake, or standalone art piece.
Step 2: Digital IllustrationUsing Adobe Illustrator, I refined sketches into vector artwork, ensuring proper line weights and color separations for manufacturing.
Step 3: Prototyping & FeedbackBefore production, I worked with manufacturers to to tweak colors and finishes, ensuring the final product matched the vision.

            Once the prototypes met quality standards, I launched the designs on
            **Etsy and Shopify**, where I optimized product listings using **SEO
            strategies and user behavior analysis**. This experience provided
            valuable insights into **consumer psychology, market positioning,
            and branding**â€”all crucial skills in product operations and
            management roles.

            The Pintern was more than a creative projectâ€”it was a hands-on case
            study in **product development, operational strategy, and user
            engagement**. Managing everything from **supply chain logistics to
            e-commerce optimization** allowed me to refine my skills in
