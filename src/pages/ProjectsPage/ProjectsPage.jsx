            In my downtime, I‚Äôm usually in one of two modes: designing or
            building things with my hands (sometimes both at once). I thrive in
            that sweet spot between form and function, whether I‚Äôm prototyping
            with a laser cutter, writing code, or shaping wood into something
            useful and beautiful. My background in operations and industrial
            design informs every step of my process, from UX thinking to
            hands-on fabrication.
            <br />
            <br /> Alongside my work in product operations, I‚Äôve explored laser
            cutting, woodworking, and graphic design, and even launched a small
            e-commerce business where I handled everything from product design
            to branding, photography, and packaging. In 2024, I stepped into web
            development and built this portfolio from the ground up‚Äîcoding in
            VSCode and deploying directly from the command line.
            <br />
            <br /> For me, creativity lives at the intersection of the tactile
            and the technical. I love turning thoughtful ideas into real,
            tangible things‚Äîand I‚Äôm excited to bring that same energy into a
            design-driven, tech-forward role. üë©üèº‚Äçüíª‚ú®
