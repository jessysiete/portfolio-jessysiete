            As a natural tinkerer, I thrive on turning ideas into tangible
            creations. In my spare time, I combine my imagination with design
            tools, laser CNC machines, and power tools to bring home goods and
            apparel accessories to life. My featured projects span sculptural
            works, textile manipulation, graphic design, and even a small
            e-commerce business I built from the ground up. In 2024, I dove into
            coding and designed this portfolio website myself, using VSCode and
            publishing it directly from the command line. These hands-on
            projects reflect my passion for design and technology, which I‚Äôm
            eager to bring into a technical role at a design-focused
            organization. üë©üèº‚Äçüíª
