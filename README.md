### Development
I chose Vite to scaffold this project for its lightweight dependencies, fast-build capabilities, as well as its current day relevance and resources.

Additionally, I needed an upgrade! My first React projects were coded using sandboxes and, the now depreciated, <code>npm create-react-app</code>.
